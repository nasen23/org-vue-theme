#+TITLE:   org-vue-theme

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
This is a fork of
[[https://github.com/blinkfox/typora-vue-theme][blinkfox/typora-vue-theme]].
Some simple modifications are made to adapt to org-mode.

* Usage
Add the following line to your org files to use the stylesheet.
#+BEGIN_SRC
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://nasen23.github.io/org-vue-theme/vue.css"/>
#+END_SRC

*Note* that the org-mode is frequently changing, so the output html file may
vary in different versions. I'm currently using Org mode 9.3.
